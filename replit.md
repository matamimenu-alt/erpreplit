# Workspace

## Overview

Multi-restaurant Management & Accounting System for Saudi Arabia. Manages 3 restaurants: **Asad Al-Hamra**, **Sabah Al-El**, **Chicken Bar**. Full-stack pnpm monorepo using TypeScript, React, and Express.

## Latest Changes (Session)
- **Food Cost & Pricing Engine Built**: New page at `/food-cost` with 3 tabs (Dishes, Pricing Analysis, Profit Simulator). New DB tables: `dishes`, `dish_ingredients`, `pricing_config`. Backend route `/api/dishes` with full pricing calculation logic.
- **Automated pricing formula**: Ingredient Cost (from purchases) + Waste % + Fixed Cost Allocation (expenses + salaries ÷ monthly orders) + Delivery Cost = Final Dish Cost → ÷ Target Food Cost % = Suggested Price.
- **Psychological pricing**: Rounds up to X.90 format (SAR 25 → SAR 25.90).
- **Delivery app pricing**: Adds delivery commission uplift (default 25%) for delivery platform price.
- **Profit Simulator**: Interactive sliders for target food cost % and waste %, shows live price/margin changes with original vs simulated comparison.
- **Ingredient autocomplete**: Pulls product names from purchase records for easy ingredient entry.

6. **HR & Payroll** — Full payroll table with grouped columns: Employee Info (Designation, Full/Part Time, Name, Nationality, Joining Date, # Months auto-calc), Basic Salary, Monthly Payroll Taxes (Social Security, Labor Fees, Iqama/mo = yearly÷3÷12, Total Taxes), Employee Benefits (Medical÷12, Indemnity=Salary÷12, AirTicket÷24, Vacation=(Salary÷30×21)÷12, Food Meal, Total Benefits), Total Labor Cost.

8. **Inventory Management** — 5-tab system:
   - *Stock Levels*: Real-time stock per item (quantity, cost, value), search + category filter, Export Excel
   - *Movements*: Log consumptions/adjustments/opening balances; filter by type/item/date; delete entries
   - *Transfers*: Inter-branch transfer form; auto-creates transfer-in and transfer-out movements
   - *Monthly Report*: COGS breakdown by item with Opening/Purchases/Consumption/Closing; Export Excel
   - *P&L Closing Stock*: Save monthly closing stock values (Food, Beverage, General) for P&L calculation
9. **ZATCA VAT Report** — Output VAT (Sales × 15%), Input VAT (from purchases), VAT Payable = Output - Input. Month filter.
10. **Financial Reports** — 3 tabs: (1) P&L Statement with full COGS + OpEx breakdown (COGS uses Opening Inventory + Purchases − Closing Inventory formula, Labour TLC, Purchase OpEx categories, Fixed Expenses), % of Revenue column, KPI cards, Print & Excel export; (2) Monthly Purchases summary; (3) Category Expense breakdown.

## Database Schema

- `sales` — daily sales records (8 channel columns + computed totals)
- `purchases` — purchase records with VAT calculation (15 categories)
- `suppliers` — supplier directory
- `supplier_products` — supplier product price history
- `employees` — employee data and monthly cost components
- `expenses` — fixed monthly expenses
- `inventory` — monthly closing stock values (food/beverage/general per restaurant)
- `stock_movements` — all stock movements (purchases, consumption, adjustments, transfers, opening balances)
- `branch_transfers` — inter-branch transfer records

## VAT Rules (Saudi ZATCA)
- VAT Rate: 15%
- Output VAT = Total Sales × 15%
- Input VAT = VAT paid on purchases
- VAT Payable = Output VAT − Input VAT

## COGS Formula (P&L)
`COGS = Opening Inventory + Total Purchases − Closing Inventory`
Opening inventory = previous month's closing stock sum; Closing inventory = saved from P&L Closing Stock tab

## API Routes
All routes under `/api/`:
- `/sales` — CRUD + `/monthly-summary`
- `/purchases` — CRUD (auto-syncs stock movements)
- `/suppliers` — CRUD + `/price-comparison` + `/products` (CRUD)
- `/employees` — CRUD
- `/expenses` — CRUD
- `/inventory` — GET/UPSERT closing stock by month
- `/stock/items` — list stock items with current quantities
- `/stock/movements` — CRUD stock movements
- `/stock/transfers` — CRUD branch transfers
- `/stock/report` — monthly stock COGS report by item
- `/vat/report` — VAT report (optional ?month=YYYY-MM)
- `/dashboard/summary` — Financial summary (optional ?month=YYYY-MM)
- `/reports/pl` — P&L report (optional ?month=YYYY-MM)

## Important Technical Notes
- App is served at root path `/` (BASE_PATH="/"). All routes are relative to root.
- `X-Restaurant-ID` header is set globally in the API client to filter data by restaurant.
- React Query v5: `onSuccess` callback removed; use `useEffect` watching `data` instead.
- Wouter router uses `base={import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, "")}` for SPA routing.
- After OpenAPI changes: run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`
- After DB schema changes: run `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`
